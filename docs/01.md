# Getting started

For now we want to get the [most basic example of OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.2/db/deb/tutorial_display_image.html) running using a `conanfile.py` and a `CMakeLists.txt`.

So lets start a new conan project

~~~sh
conan new -s conanical/0.1.0
~~~

and add a line to the `conanfile.py`:

~~~python
requires = "opencv/4.5.2"
~~~

which should get us the [opencv conan package](https://conan.io/center/opencv).

We replace the example code to `src/conanical.cpp` and remove the header file, since we won't need it.
Now it is time to adapt the `CMakeLists.txt`. Looking at the [test conan CMakeLists](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/blob/master/recipes/opencv/4.x/test_package/CMakeLists.txt) we'll need both the `cmake` as well as the `cmake_find_package` generators.

So for the `CMakeLists.txt` we'll make the following adaptions:

- include the `conanbuildinfo.cmake`
- make a `find_package` call
- link the conanical executable to the used libs

In the `conanfile.py` we add the `cmake_find_package` generator.

After trying to build the package

~~~sh
mkdir build
cd build
conan install ..
conan build ..
~~~

I still ran into two problems:

1. `libgtk2.0-dev` seems to be a requirement for `OpenCV`, which is not covered by the `conanfile.py`. Executed `sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev`.
1. I needed to adapt the conan profile to read `compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11`. See the [conan doc](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/howtos/manage_gcc_abi.html).

Afterwards everything compiled. Placing a `starry_night.jpg` at the current location and running the binary displayed the image and pressing a key closed it again.
