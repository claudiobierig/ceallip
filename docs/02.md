# Advanced example - Face Detection

After getting the very basic example running, we'll try one, which is a bit more advanced, a [face detection](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html) from the webcam.
Adding a second executable `conanical_02` to the `CMakeLists.txt` and linking to the correct libraries compiles the programm.

Running the executable however results in 2 problems:

1. The required xml files, which need to be passed as command line parameter are located in the conan cache. We use CMake to copy them to a more accessible location.
1. The camera is not detected. After some digging, I found the problem in not using the correct CMake flags for the OpenCV lib. It needs to be compiled with `opencv:with_v4l` to `True`, which is set for the OpenCV Ubuntu package. I didn't check how this behaves on another OS and didn't bother placing this in the `config_options` function with some `if` clause. The package wasn't available in the conancenter so a local build was necessary. It took some time, but worked out of the box.

After fixing the problems, the program ran correctly and detects faces and eyes.
