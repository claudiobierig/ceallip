# Adding Boost

Boost didn't cause a single problem. Used example from [programming options](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/doc/html/program_options/tutorial.html#idp337609360).
Looking at the default boost options creating a python module might be problematic. Next step will be creating a simple python3 script, which imports a boost python module. We might need to set some options in conan here.
